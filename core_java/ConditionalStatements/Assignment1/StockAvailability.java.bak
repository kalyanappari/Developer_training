/* Here Greater Than ( > ) relational Operator is used to validate the stock as we check whether the availability 
   of the product is more than zero or not.
   
   Validating the stocks in with more than zero is safer then checking the non zero stocks because it prevents unexpected cases like negative stocks values.*/
